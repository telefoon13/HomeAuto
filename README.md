# HomeAuto

Software project made to automate & easy use all my automation hardware in my house.
For Lights & roller shutter i use eltako's & Sonoff modules(Flashed with Tasmota / https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota)
For power usage i will use camera's and OCR (Still in testing phase).
For the security camera's i use Hikvision camera's & a Zoominder server to save & access the camera feeds.
For the heating i use Vaillaint with a VR920 module & there non so public API.
For the weather & temp i use Netatmo weather station (In and out) also openweather to show the icons.

Feel free to use what i made but please let me know juist out of intrest :)
