# HomeAuto

Software project made to automate & easy use all my automation hardware in my house.<br>
For Lights & roller shutter i use eltako's & Sonoff modules(Flashed with Tasmota / https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota)<br>
For power usage i will use camera's and OCR (Still in testing phase).<br>
For the security camera's i use Hikvision camera's & a Zoominder server to save & access the camera feeds.<br>
For the heating i use Vaillaint with a VR920 module & there non so public API.<br>
